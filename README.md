Automated irrigation control system using arduino
An Automated Irrigation Control System using Arduino is a smart watering system that automatically supplies water to plants based on soil moisture conditions, reducing water wastage and manual effort.

Overview

The system uses an Arduino microcontroller to monitor soil moisture levels through sensors. When the soil becomes dry (below a preset threshold), the Arduino activates a water pump or solenoid valve to irrigate the field. Once sufficient moisture is detected, the system automatically stops watering.

Main Components

* Arduino board(e.g., Arduino Uno)
* Soil moisture sensor
* Water pump / Solenoid valve
* Relay module
* Power supply
* Connecting wires and pipes

Working Principle

1. The soil moisture sensor measures the water content in the soil.
2. The sensor sends analog/digital signals to the Arduino.
3. The Arduino compares the value with a predefined threshold.
4. If the soil is dry → Pump ON.
5. If the soil is wet → Pump OFF.

Advantages

* Saves water
* Reduces labor
* Improves crop yield
* Low-cost and energy efficient
* Suitable for farms, gardens, and greenhouses

Applications

* Agricultural fields
* Home gardens
* Smart farming systems
* Greenhouses

In short, this system ensures plants receive the right amount of water at the right time automatically, making irrigation smarter and more efficient.
